**jmon** (JSON Musical Object Notation) is a declarative, backend-agnostic JSON format for multi-track musical compositions, modular audio graphs, effects, automation, looping, and advanced timing.

**Key features:**

- Multi-track with labels, synths, samplers, and per-track effects
- Tempo changes (`tempoMap`), time signature changes (`timeSignatureMap`)
- Modular routing for master/global FX (compression, reverb, etc.)
- Per-sequence effects and looping
- Sampler synths, envelopes, microtuning, velocity
- Complex parallel/serial signal graphs
- Extensible for creative music coding and DAWs

- **Full Documentation:** [jmon_specification_full.md](jmon_specification_full.md)
- **Schema:** [jmon_schema_multitrack.json](jmon_schema_multitrack.json)

See docs for detailed examples of per-sequence and global effects, samplers, and all features.
